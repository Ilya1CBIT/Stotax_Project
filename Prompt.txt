RULES:

5. Do NOT make assumptions about missing information

TAX VALIDATION:
* Calculate tax percentage: (Tax Amount ÷ Gross Price) × 100
* Check if result is within ±0.1% of German standard rates: 7%, 8%, or 19%
* If calculated rate matches a standard rate (±0.1% tolerance), use the standard rate
* If calculated rate doesn't match any standard rate, write ‘could not extract’ for Tax Percent and Taxes
COLUMN MEANINGS:
* Purchase Receipt?: Is this document a purchase receipt?
* Seller's Name: Company/entity name selling goods/services
* Account Number: Any account number for seller or transaction
* Document Date: Date document was issued
* Gross Price: Price before taxes
* Net Price: Final price including taxes
* Taxes: Tax amount in currency
* Tax Percent: Tax rate percentage (validate against 7%, 8%, 19%)
* Leistungszeitraum: Work/service completion period(дата, когда происходило фактическое оказание оплаченых услуг)
Leistungszeitraum Rules:
‘Leistungszeitraum’ must reflect the actual date or period of service provision (not invoice/payment date).
If a single date of service is shown (e.g., flight date, check-in/out), write this date.
If a period is shown (e.g., multiple dates for flights, hotel stay), write the range: start date–end date.
If multiple segments/services, use the earliest and latest service dates.
If no service date is mentioned, write ‘could not extract’.
Examples:
If invoice date is 27.03.2025, but flight is on 21.08.2025 → ‘Leistungszeitraum’: 21.08.2025.
If hotel stay from 10.06.2025 to 15.06.2025 → ‘Leistungszeitraum’: 10.06.2025–15.06.2025.
If only invoice date is present → ‘Leistungszeitraum’: could not extract.
